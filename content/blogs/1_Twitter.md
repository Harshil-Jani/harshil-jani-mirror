Namaste ! These days, The lime light is on the world's richest man Elon Musk (I love calling him Elon guy) who's been firing and conducting mass lay offs into the Twitter HQs. People are hating twitter boss due to some geographical and emotional reasons and some due to technical reasons. 

There are flyers saying making trucks and running a software company is not same. But fellas forgot about PayPal. Also this Elon Guy had worked his nights making video games and selling those all by himself. He knows tech more than your manager dude. Now, Coming to mass lay-offs, I am pretty much in the favour of reducing the task force. Not just because of I am hardcore fan of Elon Guy but think logically. You are boss at your company and you got 10 employes. One is the Senior Engineer, One Staff Engineer and one you yourself (consider yourself as a crave master of technology) and other 7 part time or full time employees with some random designations. Now, Those 7 are inefficient and becomming hinderance for you to let you work. But, You are morally a good person and don't want to let them loose their job so you don't remove them. But, Trust me one day in burn out you will end up getting bad impression for those 7 people even when they are good performers at some other task. 

If people are fired, They can find a new job. Yeah ! I do understand it is not so easy but afterall, In the world, As humans we are here to learn right ? So, Learn a lot that either you can never be fired or you can easily be hired. The rotten wheel of the world will keep revolving but it is us who needs to jump out of the wheel and follow the Brownian Movement. Talking about personal insight, I was an Intern few days back at a firm and there were mass lay offs. People around me including my roommate and batchmates were all scared and having a perception that getting a job these days is tough. Trust me, I resigned from my Intern amidst the layoffs. The reason was pretty simple, I have my own way of working and I was not a good fit for the company. 

Now these Elon guy is my favorite because he's been working really hard like days and night one ! So, This is what I respect the most about him. I hate clowns who are only for 9-5 and then not available for the rest of their day. Anyways, He has a new vision for the Twitter 2.0 which is Free Speech, Encrypted DMs, Less Hatred posts etc etc. These is what I wished always on social media. We really need less hate posts. 

Now, Coming to the 8 U.S.D supremacy for the blue tick. Like seriously speaking what's wrong in it ? If you are big celebrity then you keep posting starbuck shits on your socials but 8$ makes no sense ? The new task force at twitter is going to be workoholic so pay them the tribute. But yeah ! I do understand for some people 8 USD subscription might get a little more so I cannot completely agree with the Elon Guy on this. Anyways, If any of your tweets just gives a sense of luxuriousness then pay 8 USD instantly. 

Elon Guy fired Parag Agarwal : Indian Origin CEO but as a neutralist human, I should not take this as a personal plot while the media keeps cooking me up about national integrity of some Pacific guy discriminating an Asian. I am not really sure about the entire plot but Parag is smart guy and he also got his compensation. He can easily manage a much more deservable work environment. I have closely observed how a corporate world looks like and how collectively as a team in some exceptional cases the efficiency breaks due to involvement and interuptions of more number of people than required. So, There should be some cut down on the employees or maybe the place don't suit you up then just you can back out and jump straight into the boots in some new and more welcomming place. 

Privacy is something which is at the priority for the Elon Guy's new Twitter Model. The encrypted DMs and then the decrease of hate speech will be something which can help human to interact with much more useful stuff. Still ! This are all speculations and you can logically argue about it getting done in real but I do trust Elon Guy's words because If he says it, He means it. He's really good at solving problems and making things done correctly rather than following some clown's rotten deadlines. 

I am pretty curious waiting to see the Twitter 2.0 getting launced as early as possible. I am not falling for other alternatives since I believe the visionary Elon Guy. 


**Fun Fact :** In 2020, During the times of Covid and Lockdowns, I was lurking into twitter's comment section and something just accidently changed rest of my life. If I haven't commented into the tweet on that day, I would have been a different person from what I am today. I really appreciate the algorithm that impacted my life so much.
