A very happy new year to regular readers. With new year comes new semester and It expects me to have more efforts towards electronics core learnings irrespective of the field anyone of us would be choosing. So, With the efforts, I want to make this at an impactable Scale. With those fancy words, I am announcing to start the SPICE tutorials which for me are part of academics as "Digital Integrated Circuits". But, Maybe this would help you to get more involved with your research, Study, Exams or whatever. 

To make things at ground level, I would be writing the tutorials in layman languages. And yes, I don't posses great knowledge in electronics. This being said, There might be a possibility that I may preach a concept in wrong sense. In such cases, I would be taking full responsibility of my mistake and would consider to re-upload that piece. So, I need support from the readers if I go wrong anywhere into the journey. To do that [mail me](mailto:harshiljani2002@gmail.com) . 

Most of the time I would be using ngspice to analyse the simulations and design the circuits. So, This would be a good introductory walkthrough into the ngspice and Integrated circuit concepts. 

Let's do it then.

### SPICE : Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis

> SPICE Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) SPICE is a computer simulation and modeling program used by engineers to mathematically predict the behavior of electronics circuits.

Here, I am also adding the table of content to know, What is being going around into this tutorial series. Also, You can always pick an appropriate tag from the bottom of the blog and then filter out the tutorials to avoid middle articles.
