Consider any electronic circuit where you give some input and you get the output. Now, Use the same piece of circuit and pass the output of first circuit as input to the new circuit. Keep adding many numbers of circuits in similar fashion.

By ideal laws of nature, If for a particular entity (Here the Output Voltage of main circuit) has to be divided across more number of other entities (Here subcircuits) then this would simply result in decrease in a specific parameter (i.e Current) per unit. 

Now, Here assume an inverter. So, In the previous article, We talked about Noise Margin which would help us in giving Logic 0 and Logic 1 with the help of parameters V(OH), V(OL), V(IH) and V(IL). Now, If we  keep increasing the number of inverters to be connected on the output of the main inverter circuit, Then V(OH) will keep decreasing. Now, For a logic states to persist it is important that `V(OH)>V(IH)` otherwise the bits would simply flip resulting into the error. So, We need to keep this condition in mind and this defines the theorhetical limits of what could be maximum possible number of Inverter circuits to be added at the output end. This maximum number of subcircuits (N) is called as Fan Out for a given circuit. 

In Vocabular terms : 
> Fan out refers to the number of inputs that a single output can drive. In digital electronics, fan out refers to the number of gates or other inputs that a single output can drive without significantly degrading the signal. In networking, fan out refers to the number of devices that can be connected to a single network device, such as a switch or router.
## Theoretical Fan Out

As we can see here, I(out) is the driver current and I'(B1), I'(B2) .. I'(Bn) are driving current. 

By grokking the circuit, we can write the following equations. 
- `I(out) = N*I'(B)` { Assume I'(B)=I'(B1)=I'(B1)=I'(B3)...) }
- `I(out)=I(c)+I(Q)` using KCL.
- `V(out)=Vcc-Ic*Rc` using KVL.
- Now, When V(in) is low then Q will remain Off. And there would be no current through it. `I(Q)=0` and thus `I(out)=I(c)`.
- So Now, `I(c)=N*I'(B)`. 

$\frac{V(cc)-V(out)}{Rc}$ = N*$\frac{V(out)-V(B'sat)}{R'b}$

This is safe side fan out when we are not been given $\beta$ and K. which are the collecter to Base current ratios in Saturation and Cutt-Off region respectively. 

Now, The condition for Maximum Logic High Fan Out is `V(OH)>V(IH)`. So, In the formula we can replace the minimun possible output to V(IH). Therefore, `V(out)=V(IH)`. 

After rearranging the terms,

N = $\frac{R'b [V(cc)-V(out)]}{Rc [V(out)-V(B'sat)]}$ <= $\frac{R'b [V(cc)-V(IH)]}{Rc [V(IH)-V(B'sat)]}$

## Subcircuits

In ngspice, In order to repeat the same circuit again and again, We can use a command known as `.subckt`. This allows us to templatize the circuit and use it. I have written some very basic rules to keep in mind while designing a subcircuit. 

1. Note down the end nodes for your circuit. ( Eg : Input, Output, Ground )
2. Make sure the node names in your subcircuit are completely different from your main circuit. To ensure that this would never create any problem, I have a personalized method to achieve this sanity check. `Add i+l` to each node of your main circuit. Where i = the specific node of main circuit in subcircuit and l = the highest node number of main circuit. (Do this only if circuit is same else go with the proper netlist designing flow)
3. Using proper syntax write the subcircuit netlist. 
4. Use `X` to define any circuit as subcircuit and find the node mappings as decided in point 1. 

Let us create a subcircuit for the given RTL-Inverter Logic.

- Our End Nodes are [4,1,2,0]
- New Node Names would be `+4` from what the current number is. (Don't do it with 0 since it is ground. It won't change.)

So, New Equivalent Sub Circuit would be like

![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79367883/214691656-100e3bc6-5ee2-4e6b-8965-d8de57154db1.png)

- End Nodes are [8, 5, 6, 0]

Now, We need to map the Nodes from the Subcircuit with the main circuit. 

8 ------> 2 <br>
5 ------> 1 <br>
6 ------> Any Output Node (New) <br>
0 ------> 0 <br>

After the mapping is done, Let's put it all together into the NGSPICE syntax.

```markdown
.subckt NOT 8 5 6 0
Rcs 5 6 10k
Rbs 7 8 1k
Q1s 6 7 0 BJT
.ends
```

Using the above Subcircuit Netlist and the mapping, We can define the `X` as
```markdown
X1 2 1 out1 0 NOT
```
here X represent Subcircuit and other parameters are the mapping of what we have already defined in the defination of sub circuit. 

Now, You need to keep repeating the circuits until ```V(OH) < V(IL)```

Collectively, From the main circuit and subcircuit, You can obtain Fan out as shown below.
