This tutorial is about creating an Inverter using a BJT, Inverter is a bit flipper circuit which helps in flipping the bits from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. We will also be analysing the Noise Margin of the Inverter Circuit based on the output we would be getting.

**Noise Margin** : Assume, You have given Low Logic Input to the Inverter. Then, You should be getting the High Logic Voltage on the output side. But, What if your defination of High and Low, brings your output to become Low instead of High. In simpler terms, Bit Flips. So, The Margin of voltage between high logic and low logic is known as Noise Margin. 

> Noise margin is a measure of design margins to ensure circuits functioning properly within specified conditions.


##  Inverter Circuit

The netlist of above circuit is given as :
```markdown
.model BJT NPN
V1 1 0 dc 5
V2 4 0 pulse (5 0 0 0.1u 0.1u 20u 40u)
R1 2 1 1k
R2 4 3 1k
Q1 2 3 0 BJT
```

Simulate in transient analysis
```markdown
.tran 10u 80u 20u
```

Now, Here is the Waveform of the Inverter Circuit. This is digital Pulse Waveform.

In Order to analyse the Noise Margin for the any given Inverter Circuit. We need to plot it's DC Sweep Plot. This plot is plotted between the Input Voltage and Output Voltage. The values of voltages where Slope on the curve becomes -1 on then corressponding values on X-Axis are known as V(IL) and V(IH) respectively. Similarly, The values on Y-Axis from where the Voltage sweep starts which is Vdd is known as V(OH) and The lowest cut-off value of voltage is known as V(OL).

Thus, The Noise Margin is given as 
```c
N.M ( high ) = V(OH) - V(IH) -----> Logic 1
N.M ( low_ ) = V(IL) - V(OL) -----> Logic 0
```

To run the simulation for dc sweep to analyse Noise Margin we can do the following. 
In place of transient analysis, Do the DC Sweep analyses. 0 is Lower Voltage, 3 is Higher Voltage and 0.01 is the step size for increasing the voltage. 

```markdown
.dc V2 0 5 0.01
```

This curve is known as VTC (Voltage Transfer Curve).
