Logic GATES are most cruicial part of life. Computers are working on 0-1. But, This 0s and 1s are generated using the Voltage input. If voltage is high, We call it 1 state or high state whereas for Low we call it 0. 

Since, Childhood of our Adulthood, We have always been taught, `NAND` and `NOR` are two universal GATES using which we can design all different combination of GATES. So, This tutorial will be all about designing those two gates using BJT which is Bi-Polar Junction Transistor. Well, In case you don't know what are BJT then I have got you covered as well. You can read the basics and about working principle over here.  [BJT](https://www.electrical4u.com/bipolar-junction-transistor-or-bjt-n-p-n-or-p-n-p-transistor/)

# NAND Gate

## Circuit 

This is how you can design the NAND Gate using BJT, Resistor some voltage sources. 
Take a look at the circuit and the nodes which I have labeled.

Using this circuit as reference we are now supposed to design our Netlist. 
Here, To analyse the circuit we give Pulse Inputs. It follows the parameters as
PULSE [ Low_Voltage, High_Voltage, T(Delay), T(rise), T(fall), Pulse Width, Pulse Repeat ]
```markdown
.model BJT NPN
V1 1 0 dc 5
V2 4 0 pulse (3 0 0 0.1u 0.1u 20u 40u)
V3 5 0 pulse (0 3 0 0.1u 0.1u 10u 20u)
R3 2 1 1k
R1 4 3 1k
R2 5 6 1k
Q1 2 3 7 BJT
Q2 7 6 0 BJT
```

Now, The next step is to define and run the simulation. 
```
.tran 10u 80u 20u
```
Here we run the transient analysis and it's parameters are [ Step Time, Stop Time, Initial Time ]

## Netlist

```
.model BJT NPN
V1 1 0 dc 5
V2 4 0 pulse (3 0 0 0.1u 0.1u 20u 40u)
V3 5 0 pulse (0 3 0 0.1u 0.1u 10u 20u)
R3 2 1 1k
R1 4 3 1k
R2 5 6 1k
Q1 2 3 0 BJT
Q2 2 6 0 BJT
```

Simulation remains same

```
.tran 10u 80u 20u
```

With the help of this two Gates, The destiny of thy should roll over to lease out newer Gates.
