I got a lot of people asking me some random questions about GSoC. I do appreciate your enthusiasm to apply for a program like this but I do hate few things in general which are really not good to ask anyone in life not just for GSoC but even in your tech journey. No one is really that much available to answer such random questions. I do understand it is not easy to just get started without proper guidance. But a good amount of questioning is something which makes more sense rather than good guidance okay !!

Let me start by explaining an annoying situation first. You are a 20 Years Old Kid. And someone who is just 18 or just passed out from the school comes to you. On the main street road. You were stading with an "Apple (fruit)" in your hand. Follow the below conversation -

Kid : "WHAT ARE YOU EATING ?" <br>
You : "AN APPLE." <br> 
Kid : "OKAY. BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO EAT IT NOW ?" <br>
You : "BECAUSE I FELT HUNGRY AND I LIKE APPLES AND THIS IS WHAT I HAVE NOW." <br>
Kid : "IS IT OKAY IF I ALSO EAT APPLE NOW ?" <br>
You : "YEAH. IT PRETTY MUCH DEPENDS ON YOU. IF YOU ARE HUNGRY TOO THEN GO FOR IT." <br>
Kid : "OKAY THANKS" <br>

If this conversation feels like some rubbish example explaining the situation I get caught into then thankyou for knowing the suffering and sweat for facing it.

### `Do I need to know each and every technology an organization mentions ?`
 
The more you do, the better it is. Try to understand the right part of the project you are aiming for. GSoC is proposal oriented program where you shoot maximum three proposals to the organization you want to apply. Each proposal can be crafted to aim a particular project of any organization and not the organization in general. The tech stacks you see on the board of organization is written for group of projects all together. You should find the project by your own and get comfortable with the developer ecosystem which they adopt. 

### `If there is one project, do I need to solve all bugs in that project or a few issues from the issues section in the repository?`

Yes, trust me , A guy literally boomed me away by asking this. I have to be polite to beginners because this is what I got in my early days. But all in all, I was not this much abstracted. Still no one at blame. Answer is that : It is not necessary to close all the bugs. The more you do, The better it is. In case if they expect you to close all the bugs into a GSoC project then just imagine the ideality of the project. The project has to be super dooper ideal to attain this kind of decorundum where they except no one else but a GSoC student to solve all of their bugs.

### `How many projects get selected each time per organization?`

No one knows the secret. The proposals are ranked and based on it Google allotes slots to organizations. So, Even the Org Admin cannot answer this question so I am much much far to answer this as of now. 

### `How do I apply for GSoC and how do you got into GSoC community?`

I hate this question the most and the more I hate it, more people asks me about this. Look majesty, "How to apply to GSoC" is not something which I have to tell you alright. This can be looked by you yourself after visiting the official site. You are disrespecting the developer efforts that the people spend into making each and every detail into the GSoC site and the GSoC community. Now coming to my journey, So, I can tell you this personally as well or shoot you link to my crafted GSoC Book. But one pro tip is go and stalk peoples github and gitlab or any such public profiles. Even on the Official GSoC website find my blog. My written code. There is a reason why we craft blogs for the work we did. Go and read them. You will know more than what person did and would love to express. 

### `How to find time to contribute ?`

Go to sleep child. If you don't have time to contribute to open source, You should not be reading my post either. Doing contribution is more precious than reading this truckload of posts written by me.

### ` Will you help me in my proposal ? `

Something, Which can potentially be the red mark in our relation. No matter who you are a friend, girlfriend, relative, cousin, siblinggrandmother, grandfather, my cat, my dog but only advice is that I can help you in making the proposal only under strict 2 conditions.

1. I am your GSoC Mentor.
2. I have past experience working with that project.

Any extra bit of condition which you might be trying to get into is something which I strongly disregard. If i help you in making the proposal then it makes absolutely no sense of getting into GSoC. This serves no purpose. You will end up occupying someone's place and not being able to complete your task. I cannot spoon feed. Offcouse, I am open for comments and help regarding the formatting. But, Technically If it takes the efforts of going through some docs of your project or orgs to understand what is going under the hoods is something I hate the most doing it for others. Neither I was spoon feeded nor anyone whom I adore the most in world of programming. Please never ask me to do so if you feel I might be more helpful to you in something else apart from GSoC. I will strictly not help you out in crafting a proposal. You can ask queries in more fashioned way. I can say the approach but proposal is something you are making based on your findings about the project. I cannot come and write down an Abstract for you.

There are a lot more FAQs which may not be asked. A simple generic advice is learn how to contribute into open source and then GSoC will become your side product.
