Hi ! I am currently a Pre-Final Year Electronics and Communications as well as Computer Science Engineer who likes working with some old school stuff and mainly I am old fashioned guy maybe that's what people assume about me untill they have a look at my fancy ricing which is nothing great for linux lovers and it's very normal i3WM rice. Some unfamiliar guy or girl thinks it's great to rice a system and it happens with some supernatural powers but that's just because they love their laptop more which binds them to do more and more experiments. 

As per society, I must be a guy going in a flow learning college courses and doing some Web Dev intern but afterall I sneak at nights and try getting myself some time to learn about compilers and the Linux and Rust ecosystem. 

I may seem wierd or least expressive but trust me, It's just because I cannot speak with different tones and you may never get the exactness of my speech and expression. But If I say it I mean it. 

I never show my love for coding saying I am coder, programmer, developer etc. But instead I say I am a Linux user and I rice my OS'es. But Linux is something which keeps me mentally stable for some reasons. I am short tempered and impatient. But If you are some recruiter willing to give me some really lucrative offers then I take my words back because I need some of your assests to work for you (Or to continue what I want to do I need money).

I find Bunnies, Cats, Crabs, Hamsters as very very cute things in the world. In fact, I am the official Bunny drawer at my university. If you are someone with whom I would be sitting next or talking to in any sense and you ever in your life showed me some notebook there is a chance that there is already some bunny sneaking in one of your last pages. And I also love drinking COCO also known as Chocolately Thick Shake. 

I can work really hard even if I am dumb which most of the times I really am, But the only condition is let me work hard and not expect from me to work hard. I really need some sleep in life because on average I sleep 3 to 4 hours a day. 

People think I am bloated because I just keep siting all the day. Atleast they are correct here. So, This do reveal I also appreciate the fact that other people are right sometimes. This shows my quality of accepting the righteousness of the people. 

Afterall, This could be a more formal section but, I am like some kid about whom no ones is interested to know since I don't do Web-D or Machine Learning or Competitive Stuffs and also my majors is not Computers but yeah do remember my minors is Computers which make no difference in what I do all day with my laptop. Anyways, All I meant was that I am almost sure that just like many of the things which I created in past and destroyed them ahead in future, The same would be the fate of this Portfolio. This exposes that, I cannot outreach my work, So better to have a really good communicative person on board with me in team in case if you are a recruiter. But in case you don't have one, Don't worry. I am assuming that I articulated myself really well that you are still reading about me and this shows I can even Outreach in some exceptional scenarios. To talk of some acheivement, I gave a talk in front of panel of Scientists at CERN-HSF because I had to present my Google Summer of Code Project in front of them. It was really great experience in my life. 

Well, So all in all. I love Open Source and Linux and is always looking for remote jobs all the time. But if you have on campus job then too I am fine with it, Just reach me out on my socials.
