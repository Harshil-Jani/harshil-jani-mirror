<!-- The paragraph after the h1 and ul and before the first h2 is optional. It
is intended to be used for a short summary. -->
I am an engineering student pursing Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications
along with Minors in Computer Science. I keep exploring tech domains and learn it. I can
turn out to be a creative person along with my technicalities. Currently, I want to gain
industrial insights by applying my learnings.

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>Software Development Intern, Samagra</span> <div style="text-align: right">Sept 2022 - Currently Working</div>

Samagra leads in consulting and producing the impactfull schemes for the State Government and operates majorly in 4 Indian States : Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Oddisa and Uttar Pradesh. To meet their end goals of schemes they propose to the CMO (Chief Minister Office) there is a tech team working to build scalable digital products required by governments. 

- Worked for Improving the existing Samarth Admin which was role based admin console for the government schools of Himachal Pradesh. Technologies which we used was `React Admin`, `GraphQL`, `Hasura` etc. 
- Dealt with a real time delivery project with constant monitoring for the PT reviews and deploying to production vertically while being mapped with a Product Manager and extensively supporting tech team.


### <span>Google Summer of Code '22 Contributor</span> <div style="text-align: right">May 2022 - Sept 2022</div>

The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to contributors who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. For the open source enthusiast this is one of the greatest program to participate in it. 

- Got selected in GSoC'22 under CERN-HSF and was working to help the developers of the Geant4 Software to get good visuals and clarity of the performance for the code they write after each release of minor versions. 
- Did the performance analysis using the `Perf` tool which is part of Linux Kernel. We collected the metrics affecting the CPU and got them converted into some sensible CSV files. 
- Using the CSV data, I have created the Data Visuals like Neat Table Reports, Flamegraphs, TreeMaps, Scatter Plots, Spider Plots etc. using `D3.js`. 
- Finally, with the help of my mentor who was Scientific Software Developer and a Physicist , I learnt a lot about what we actually aim to achieve with the software. He helped me with the Jenkins Integration of the reports into the Pipeline so the charts and visuals get updated anytime there is a new commit. 

### <span>Code for GovTech</span> <div style="text-align: right">Jun 2022 - Aug 2022</div>

C4GT has been conceptualized as a summer coding program to create a community that can build and contribute to global digital public goods.An opportunity for engineering students from various campuses in India to experience the GovTech space.Organized annually over 3 months, anchored by Samagra with support from partners. There will be a set of GovTech problem statements every year for the participants to work on. 

- I was shortlisted for the X-Admin Project for Sunbird-RC . Sunbird RC is an open-source software framework for rapidly building electronic registries, enable attestation capabilities, and build verifiable credentialing with minimal effort. X-Admin is an open-source, low-code framework to create internal admin tools for governance use cases.
- Created an auto-generative solution using `Yeo-Man Code Generator` for Sunbird-RC Schemas and X-Admin .
- The use case was for Educational Bodies which were using Sunbird Schemas and APIs and was at scale for Haryana Government
- Wrote an Admin using `React-Admin` which builds on its own while updating the Schemas from Sunbird RC
- Communication can be made from Admin to API and from API to admin with added support of `GraphQL` and `REST` based APIs.
