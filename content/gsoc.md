Ah I don't want to create repeatitions over and over but yeah ! This portfolio is built with `Zola` which is one of the finest Rust based tool and so does in my past exist another piece of software known as `GSOC Book` which is also crafted by another rust tool which is `mdBook`. So, Here is the link to my GSoC Book which you can read out and criticize me and my writing skills.
